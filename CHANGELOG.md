### Added

- Language status item to bottom bar. Pressing `{}` next to `Swift` label will display current swift version and a link to the `Package.swift` for the currently open project.

- Inlay hints are enabled by default.
- Use Language client middleware to catch Document Symbol requests and use the results to update test list in TestExplorer.
- Don't send unfocus events when opening non-file based view. Means current project stays in focus and project dependencies view won't disappear.

- Tasks setup in `tasks.json` use the correct version of swift.
- Restarting the LSP server after changing the `serverPath` setting actually uses new setting.
- Windows: Test Explorer messaging when nothing is built.
- Windows: Launching of tests
