# Extension Settings

The Visual Studio Code Swift extension comes with a number of settings you can use to control how it works. This document details what each of these settings does.

### Swift: Path

This is the folder that the `swift` executable can be found in. If this is not set then the extension will look for executables in the $PATH. The extension will also use this setting when looking for other executables it requires like `sourcekit-lsp` and `lldb`.

### Swift: Build Arguments

This is a list of additional arguments passed to the `swift build` calls the extension makes. Argument keys and values should be provided as separate entries in the array e.g. `['-Xswiftc', '-warn-concurrency']`. This setting is only applied to the default build tasks generated by the extension. If you have created custom versions of these tasks in `tasks.json` the setting will not be applied. Instead you will need to edit the arguments list in the `tasks.json` file.

### Swift: Auto Generate Launch Configurations

When a SwiftPM project is loaded into Visual Studio Code the Swift extension will automatically generate debug and release launch configurations for [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for any executable in the package. This setting allows you to disable this if you would prefer to setup your own launch configurations.

### Swift: Problem Match Compile Errors

When this is enabled any errors or warnings from a `swift build` will be listed in the problems view. There is a chance these compile "problems" will double up with "problems" coming from SourceKit-LSP but the list of issues will be more comprehensive. The compile "problems" will only disappear after a `swift build` indicates they are resolved.

### Swift: Exclude Paths From Package Dependencies

This is a list of paths to exclude from the Package Dependency View.

### Sourcekit-LSP: Server Path

The path of the `sourcekit-lsp` executable. As mentioned above the default is to look in the folder where the `swift` executable is found.

### Sourcekit-LSP: Server Arguments

This is a list of arguments that will be passed to the SourceKit-LSP. Argument keys and values should be provided as separate entries in the array e.g. `['--log-level', 'debug']`.

### Sourcekit-LSP: Inlay Hints

This controls the display of Inlay Hints. Inlay Hints are variable annotations indicating their inferred type. They are only available if you are using Swift 5.6 or later.

### Sourcekit-LSP: Trace: Server

Trace the communication between Visual Studio Code and the SourceKit-LSP server. The output from this is sent to an Output Window called "Sourcekit Language Server"
