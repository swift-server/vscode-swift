# Contributing

## Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development

To begin development on the VSCode extension for Swift you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). On Linux, make sure to install Node.js from its official website or from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/) as the version included with your Linux distribution may be outdated.

Next, clone this repository, and in the project directory run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

When you first open the project in VSCode you will be recommended to also install [`ESLint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [`Prettier - Code formatter`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [`esbuild Problem Matchers`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.esbuild-problem-matchers). Please do so. `ESLint`, `Prettier - Code formatter` are used to ensure a consistent style and expect everyone who contributes to follow this style as well. `esbuild Problem Matchers` provides proper error output from building the project.

To run your version of the Swift extension while in VSCode, press `F5`. This will open up another instance of VSCode with it running. You can use the original version of VSCode to debug it. 

## Submitting a bug or issue

Please ensure to include the following in your bug report:
- A consise description of the issue, what happened and what you expected.
- Simple reproduction steps
- Version of the extension you are using
- Contextual information (Platform, Swift version etc)

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please ensure to include the following in your Pull Request (PR):
- A description of what you are trying to do. What the PR provides to the library, additional functionality, fixing a bug etc
- A description of the code changes
- Documentation on how these changes are being tested
- Additional tests to show your code working and to ensure future changes don't break your code.

Please keep your PRs to a minimal number of changes. If a PR is large, try to split it up into smaller PRs. Don't move code around unnecessarily as it makes comparing old with new very hard. If you have plans for a large change please talk to the maintainers of the project beforehand. There is a `#vscode-swift` channel on the Swift Server Slack. You can [join here](https://join.slack.com/t/swift-server/shared_invite/zt-5jv0mzlu-1HnA~7cpjL6IfmZqd~yQ2A).

### Testing

Where possible any new feature should have tests that go along with it, to ensure it works and will continue to work in the future. When a PR is submitted one of the prerequisites for it to be merged is that all tests pass. You can run tests locally using either of the following methods:
- From VSCode, by selecting "Extension Tests" in the Run and Debug activity.
- Using `npm run test` from the command line (when VS Code is not running, or you'll get an error)
